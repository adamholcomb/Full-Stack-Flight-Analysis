# Full Stack Flight Analysis

This analysis takes data from an API to a final HTML product.

The process is as follows:
1. Use pandas with skyscanner API to import data
2. Loop over API to get data for chosen dates/airports
3. Clean and transform data
4. Create SQL database and export data from python
5. Create flask API server to pull data from SQL into javascript
6. Use javascript to create visualizations: charts and maps
7. Combine and arrange visualizations in HTML, applying CSS formatting
